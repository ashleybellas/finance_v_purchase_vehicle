# Should I purchase outright or finance my vehicle and invest the rest?
I wrote a simple script to compare the net worth of an individual who either (i) purchases a vehicle outright or (ii) finances the vehicle and invests the remainder in the market (assuming they had enough cash to consider buying it outright). My husband is in car sales and some people just prefer to purchase outright and avoid the hassle of financing. However, if you are economically astute, you'll see that for most people with decent credit, financing the vehicle and investing the rest results in a high net worth at the end of the financing period compared to purchasing outright. 

Using the code linked below, you can modify the interest rate on the loan, the financing period, the expected rate of return on your (hypothetical) investment account, etc.
